My friend Raybo highly recommended that I attend the show. He & Mrs Raybo had also turned me on to Royal Blood & The Struts so, based on their credibility, I didn't hesitate to get a ticket. Lots of kids in the audience (if they're younger than my 39-year old daughter, they're a kid!) so lots of enthusiasm in the building. Fun show with lots of big sound & big staging.Includes the tour itinerary & some okay pics taken with my crappy iPhone 8.Enjoy!!",

                            Used by Muse management to share live tracks into the muse.mu audio player in January 2005 (hysteria, micro cuts, space dementia, ruled by secrecy).
                            I didn't know that this master CD could exist 20 years later and would be offered for sale, that's why I didn't hesitate. I'm happy to share with you what Muse could have added for Absolution's XX anniversary, in the best possible audio quality (no loss).

    "content": "I'm sharing a full remaster I just completed yesterday for the 2006-06-28 Shepherds Bush Empire gig. I at least got this finished and uploaded on the correct date, even though it is 2 years too early to be a true 20 year anniversary, so it is the ALMOST 20 year anniversary hahaIt started from me wanting to do this remaster edit on Supermassive Black Hole since this has the single best performance of that song. I just decided to keep going with it once that song turned out the way it did. This is the way this gig was meant to heard. Please use decent headphones or put it on in the car to really experience how this sounds - playing on your phone likely won't do much.I made these as 320kbps MP3s because there is absolutely no reason to bloat the files since the best source for the audio (only some songs, not even all of them) had a bit rate of 384kbps. There will be no noticeable difference/loss - they still sound amazing.
                            For anyone familiar with this, it was annoying that there was never a single broadcast source, so it had to be patched together from multiple sources. This made it feel like a collection of single songs rather than an actual gig, so I tried to splice them all together to make it feel like a single cohesive performance. Only exception being track 6 into 7 where there was just nothing I could do there.
                            Grab it, turn it up, and please let me know what you think! I would welcome any feedback if it could have been done better - I think it came out ACE. I also recommend trying it with no EQ first since I make me edits to sound good without it.",

Some of you might know Mark, he was very active in the late 90's and all throughout the 00's, he was a very well respected trader who started taping and filming shows. Mark helped me get started in trading when it all went online in the late 90's/early 00's and I owe the guy a lot, he was an absolute pleasure to deal with. Unfortunately Mark passed away recently and his wife got in touch with me regarding his bootleg collection, TravisBickle1963 very kindly helped collect the collection and go through a lot of discs so a lot of credit goes to him for making these available to the fans, check out his YouTube channel if you ever want your tapes transferring - https://www.youtube.com/@TravisBickle1963But of course, all credit to Mark for filming and taping so many great shows, a great loss to the trading community. If you decide to share this elsewhere, please give the credit to Mark pleaseThis is his old trading site if this brings back any memories - https://web.archive.org/web/20080101124722/http://www.freewebs.com/bootlegs4trade/index.htmStream 2Original ID: 224Codec: MPEG-1/2 Video (mpgv)Type: VideoVideo resolution: 720x576Buffer dimensions: 720x576Frame rate: 25Decoded format:Orientation: Top leftChroma location: LeftVideo bitrate: 9000kbpsStream 3Original ID: 48512Codec: A52 Audio (aka AC3) (a52 )Type: AudioChannels: StereoSample rate: 48000 HzBits per sample: 32Bitrate: 192 kb/s",

For trading or gifting only. DO NOT SELL.Notes:-After two nights in Montreal, it was time to warm up a bit and fly to New York for St. Patrick's Day! Visiting Madison Square Garden had always been on my bucket list. Seeing Muse live at Madison Square Garden from the front row? Unforgettable.-Forever grateful to Catherine for saving a spot for me on the barrier. I queued from 5am and was #11 in line but missed the initial round of wristbands that were given out by MSG staff at 9am. I cannot tell you how distressed I was over this. But Catherine is the absolute BEST. This just so happened to also be her 200th Muse gig! Matt thought it would be appropriate to dedicate Madness to her, lol.-Last time I was in NYC for the 2022 Beacon show, I was lucky enough to get a pick from Matt's guitar tech. This time he gave me Matt's own stage taped setlist. Absolutely made my night!-This bootleg was recorded with an old cheap model Samsung sat upside down inside the front pocket of my jeans. It does the trick! Overall, I think this turned out to be one of my best sounding recordings. Quite clear, except for the heavier parts... then you'll hear some distortion. This is most evident during songs like Won't Stand Down and Kill Or Be Killed. Sorry, my little phone mic did its best. It was VERY loud in the front row.-I also filmed video of the entire show. Both Evanescence and Muse, plus a little One OK Rock. You can watch these videos on my YouTube playlist for MSG here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVXWNESJqYMR4hasA0EPTUrgHsXWIQNBlPlease subscribe to my channel at http://www.youtube.com/siberwolf-I recorded audio of Evanescence's complete opening set for this date as well. If interested in that recording, let me know.Hope you enjoy,~siberwolf",

For trading or gifting only. DO NOT SELL.Notes:-For Montreal night two, I ended up in the same spot at the end of the catwalk/front of the b-stage as the night previous, so these two recordings are comparable in quality.-I apologize on the behalf of Jose (aka the "orange beanie guy"), who was next to me on the barrier, for his singing during Liberation, lol. He was living the dream and got to attend every date on the North American tour. It was fun experiencing a show with him!-This bootleg was recorded with an old cheap model Samsung sat upside down inside the front pocket of my jeans. It does the trick! You will hear some distortion during particularly loud moments (e.g. enthusiastic audience screamers or heavier guitar parts) due to the loudness overloading the phone's mic. Also, because the end of the catwalk is rather far from the main stage, there is a subtle distant "fishbowl" sound to this recording that I couldn't really fix. Compare this to my much clearer Madison Square Garden audio (front row, main stage) a few nights later, and the difference is rather noticeable. With that said, this recording still turned out pretty nice.-I also captured video of the entire show (both Muse & Evanescence).

For trading or gifting only. DO NOT SELL.Notes:-This was my first show (of seven) for the Will Of The People World Tour. I was quite sad when Atlanta didn't get an arena date this time around (we did eventually get a festival date), so I knew I'd have to travel if I wanted to see this tour proper. I got tix for Madison Square Garden in NYC, but when a 2nd night was announced for Montreal, I decided to do both dates in Montreal as well. -A special moment for me occurred on this night when someone from the Muse crew handed me a folded up setlist during You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween. I had a tiny sign on the back of my phone asking "setlist please" but I never expected to just be gifted a setlist like that, much less while the concert was still ongoing! So about a minute into Halloween you can hear me randomly saying "thank you" with several "oh my gods" from my barrier companions and myself... that was in reference to receiving this setlist. Thank you Muse!-This bootleg was recorded with an old cheap model Samsung sat upside down inside the front pocket of my jeans. It does the trick!

I did this using my Sennheiser HD650s which are very neutral reference class cans, so you shouldn't need to use any EQ. It is a great, underrated gig that I though could use some love!

My friend Raybo highly recommended that I attend the show. He & Mrs Raybo had also turned me on to Royal Blood & The Struts so, based on their credibility, I didn't hesitate to get a ticket. Lots of kids in the audience (if they're younger than my 39-year old daughter, they're a kid!) so lots of enthusiasm in the building. Fun show with lots of big sound & big staging.Includes the tour itinerary & some okay pics taken with my crappy iPhone 8.Enjoy!!",

                            I didn't know that this master CD could exist 20 years later and would be offered for sale, that's why I didn't hesitate. I'm happy to share with you what Muse could have added for Absolution's XX anniversary, in the best possible audio quality (no loss).

    "content": "I'm sharing a full remaster I just completed yesterday for the 2006-06-28 Shepherds Bush Empire gig. I at least got this finished and uploaded on the correct date, even though it is 2 years too early to be a true 20 year anniversary, so it is the ALMOST 20 year anniversary hahaIt started from me wanting to do this remaster edit on Supermassive Black Hole since this has the single best performance of that song. I just decided to keep going with it once that song turned out the way it did. This is the way this gig was meant to heard. Please use decent headphones or put it on in the car to really experience how this sounds - playing on your phone likely won't do much.I made these as 320kbps MP3s because there is absolutely no reason to bloat the files since the best source for the audio (only some songs, not even all of them) had a bit rate of 384kbps. There will be no noticeable difference/loss - they still sound amazing.
                            For anyone familiar with this, it was annoying that there was never a single broadcast source, so it had to be patched together from multiple sources. This made it feel like a collection of single songs rather than an actual gig, so I tried to splice them all together to make it feel like a single cohesive performance. Only exception being track 6 into 7 where there was just nothing I could do there.
                            Grab it, turn it up, and please let me know what you think! I would welcome any feedback if it could have been done better - I think it came out ACE. I also recommend trying it with no EQ first since I make me edits to sound good without it.",

Some of you might know Mark, he was very active in the late 90's and all throughout the 00's, he was a very well respected trader who started taping and filming shows. Mark helped me get started in trading when it all went online in the late 90's/early 00's and I owe the guy a lot, he was an absolute pleasure to deal with. Unfortunately Mark passed away recently and his wife got in touch with me regarding his bootleg collection, TravisBickle1963 very kindly helped collect the collection and go through a lot of discs so a lot of credit goes to him for making these available to the fans, check out his YouTube channel if you ever want your tapes transferring - https://www.youtube.com/@TravisBickle1963But of course, all credit to Mark for filming and taping so many great shows, a great loss to the trading community. If you decide to share this elsewhere, please give the credit to Mark pleaseThis is his old trading site if this brings back any memories - https://web.archive.org/web/20080101124722/http://www.freewebs.com/bootlegs4trade/index.htmStream 2Original ID: 224Codec: MPEG-1/2 Video (mpgv)Type: VideoVideo resolution: 720x576Buffer dimensions: 720x576Frame rate: 25Decoded format:Orientation: Top leftChroma location: LeftVideo bitrate: 9000kbpsStream 3Original ID: 48512Codec: A52 Audio (aka AC3) (a52 )Type: AudioChannels: StereoSample rate: 48000 HzBits per sample: 32Bitrate: 192 kb/s",

For trading or gifting only. DO NOT SELL.Notes:-After two nights in Montreal, it was time to warm up a bit and fly to New York for St. Patrick's Day! Visiting Madison Square Garden had always been on my bucket list. Seeing Muse live at Madison Square Garden from the front row? Unforgettable.-Forever grateful to Catherine for saving a spot for me on the barrier. I queued from 5am and was #11 in line but missed the initial round of wristbands that were given out by MSG staff at 9am. I cannot tell you how distressed I was over this. But Catherine is the absolute BEST. This just so happened to also be her 200th Muse gig! Matt thought it would be appropriate to dedicate Madness to her, lol.-Last time I was in NYC for the 2022 Beacon show, I was lucky enough to get a pick from Matt's guitar tech. This time he gave me Matt's own stage taped setlist. Absolutely made my night!-This bootleg was recorded with an old cheap model Samsung sat upside down inside the front pocket of my jeans. It does the trick! Overall, I think this turned out to be one of my best sounding recordings. Quite clear, except for the heavier parts... then you'll hear some distortion. This is most evident during songs like Won't Stand Down and Kill Or Be Killed. Sorry, my little phone mic did its best. It was VERY loud in the front row.-I also filmed video of the entire show. Both Evanescence and Muse, plus a little One OK Rock. You can watch these videos on my YouTube playlist for MSG here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVXWNESJqYMR4hasA0EPTUrgHsXWIQNBlPlease subscribe to my channel at http://www.youtube.com/siberwolf-I recorded audio of Evanescence's complete opening set for this date as well. If interested in that recording, let me know.Hope you enjoy,~siberwolf",

For trading or gifting only. DO NOT SELL.Notes:-For Montreal night two, I ended up in the same spot at the end of the catwalk/front of the b-stage as the night previous, so these two recordings are comparable in quality.-I apologize on the behalf of Jose (aka the "orange beanie guy"), who was next to me on the barrier, for his singing during Liberation, lol. He was living the dream and got to attend every date on the North American tour. It was fun experiencing a show with him!-This bootleg was recorded with an old cheap model Samsung sat upside down inside the front pocket of my jeans. It does the trick! You will hear some distortion during particularly loud moments (e.g. enthusiastic audience screamers or heavier guitar parts) due to the loudness overloading the phone's mic. Also, because the end of the catwalk is rather far from the main stage, there is a subtle distant "fishbowl" sound to this recording that I couldn't really fix. Compare this to my much clearer Madison Square Garden audio (front row, main stage) a few nights later, and the difference is rather noticeable. With that said, this recording still turned out pretty nice.-I also captured video of the entire show (both Muse & Evanescence).

For trading or gifting only. DO NOT SELL.Notes:-This was my first show (of seven) for the Will Of The People World Tour. I was quite sad when Atlanta didn't get an arena date this time around (we did eventually get a festival date), so I knew I'd have to travel if I wanted to see this tour proper. I got tix for Madison Square Garden in NYC, but when a 2nd night was announced for Montreal, I decided to do both dates in Montreal as well. -A special moment for me occurred on this night when someone from the Muse crew handed me a folded up setlist during You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween. I had a tiny sign on the back of my phone asking "setlist please" but I never expected to just be gifted a setlist like that, much less while the concert was still ongoing! So about a minute into Halloween you can hear me randomly saying "thank you" with several "oh my gods" from my barrier companions and myself... that was in reference to receiving this setlist. Thank you Muse!-This bootleg was recorded with an old cheap model Samsung sat upside down inside the front pocket of my jeans. It does the trick!
